# About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning Python and C++. As a junior in college, I feel like I am late to the game, but this is just encouragement to me to learn as much as I can.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me expand my skillset. I think one of the best ways to grow is to work with others.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding any essential resources that a new programmer should know (thanks in advance).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been rock climbing since 2021.
